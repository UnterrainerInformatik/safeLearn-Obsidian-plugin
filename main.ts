 * The plugin enforces nothing. Its whole value is that a person writing a
 * document can see what the server will do with it before publishing - so where
 * the two disagree the marking does not merely mislead about a detail, it
 * misleads about the only thing it is for. Each rule here is written as
 * `obsidian.js` writes it, and there is one of each, used by the editor and by
 * the rendered view alike: two rules for one tag form in one plugin is what let
 * the two halves drift apart in opposite directions.
 *
 * Every rule is returned from a function rather than kept in a constant. A
 * global regular expression remembers where it last stopped, so a shared one
 * asked twice whether it matches answers differently the second time.
